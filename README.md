# VAai — Call Center Payment Card Agent

VAai is a modular conversational AI designed for bank call centers to automate and enhance
payment-card support. The agent authenticates callers, resolves issues such as activation,
freezing, disputes, and proactively manages fraud concerns while meeting PCI-DSS, KYC, and GDPR
requirements.

## Key Features

- **Client Verification:** Multi-factor flows (OTP, voice biometrics) with risk-based escalation.
- **Card Management:** Activation, freeze/reissue, spend controls, travel notices.
- **Transaction Support:** Charge explanations, dispute initiation, refund tracking.
- **Personalized Service:** CRM-powered recommendations, loyalty recognition, empathy-driven tone.
- **Compliance & Security:** Automatic redaction, audit trails, anomaly detection.
- **Agent Orchestration:** Workflow routing, observability, and escalation ticketing.

```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and package (e.g., `pip install -e .`) once packaging metadata is added.
2. Instantiate integrations with secure API credentials.
3. Register intent handlers and build the `VAaiAgent` via `create_agent`.
4. Connect the agent to your telephony or chat channel adapter.

## Next Steps

- Implement real connectors for CRM, card systems, and fraud detection.
- Add retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for policy and FAQ responses.
- Instrument analytics exporters and RLHF feedback ingestion.
- Build automated compliance test harness and redaction validators.
